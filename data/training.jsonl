And, of\ncourse, there will have to be new \"sub-positions\", like the power center\nwho just sits in the slot until the (blue, of course) puck comes near him,\nand the \"shooting defenseman\" and the \"point defenseman\".

Ville Siren's slap\n shot from the blue line on power play made it 1-1, and Juha Riihijarvi\n scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal\n put the puck high over Aslin, 1-2 after the first period.\n The Finns started the second period with really good pressure. Korpisalo\n made it 1-3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin. Then,\n during the Finnish pressure, Sweden turned the game around in 1:47.\n Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal, and passed the puck to\n Jan Larsson in front, who backhanded the puck low, 2-3. Rundqvist entered\n the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund, and the Finnish defense let Ahlund \n skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal, 3-3.\n Next, Roger Hansson -behind the goal- sent the puck back to the blue line\n where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didn't see the puck since\n there was traffic in front, 4-3.\n Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan \"the Shadow\" Nilsson. Stefan\n and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone, Patrik passed the puck back to\n Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake, 5-3.\n Then, Keijo Sailynoja show started. He reduce and equalized the lead in only\n 21 seconds! First he scored the 5-4 goal, and after that he came in alone \n with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot. Sailynoja\n made a nice penalty shot, showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot.\n The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6-5 goal\n late in the game on a nice power play combination. Renberg waited in the slot,\n showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side, Ahlund passed the puck\n and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterer's goal's far side.\n But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the\n game's final goal to make it 6-6. Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow\n angle that -maybe- Aslin should have saved.\n\n All in all, a decent game where the defense wasn't the best.\n Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period\n to try no combinations.\n\n Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team. Larsson-\n Nilsson-Juhlin best line overall again, it seems to be a working WC line.\n Stillman good on defense.\n Some players aren't good enough for the WC though. Hakan Ahlund (faell ner\n hjaelmen och jobba!), Roger Hansson, Challe Berglund, Kenny Jonsson\n will likely have to leave for NHL pros.\n\n Two-goal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the\n Finnish team. Markus Ketterer didn't have a very good game, we've seen him\n a lot better, so Lindfors is probably Finland's starting goalie in the WC.\n I heard that Esa Tikkanen will join the Finnish team.

Going into the 1992\/93 season, the numbers of Euros on\nNHL teams have escalated to the following stats:\n\nCanadians: 400\nAmericans: 100\nEuropeans: 100\n\n   Please note that these numbers are rounded off, and taken from the top\n25 players on each of the 24 teams. My source is the Vancouver Sun.\n\n   Here's the point: there are far too many Europeans in the NHL. I am sick\nof watching a game between an American and a Canadian team (let's say, the\nRed Wings and the Canucks) and seeing names like \"Bure\" \"Konstantinov\" and\n\"Borshevshky\". Is this North America or isn't it? Toronto, Detriot, Quebec,\nand Edmonton are particularly annoying, but the numbers of Euros on other\nteams is getting worse as well. \n\n    I live in Vancouver and if I hear one more word about \"Pavel Bure, the\nRussian Rocket\" I will completely throw up. As it is now, every time I see\nthe Canucks play I keep hoping someone will cross-check Bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher. (By the way, I'm not a\nCanucks fan to begin with ;-). \n\n    Okay, the stretcher remark was a little carried away. But the point is that\nI resent NHL owners drafting all these Europeans INSTEAD of Canadians (and\nsome Americans). It denies young Canadians the opportunity to play in THEIR\nNORTH AMERICAN LEAGUE and instead gives it to Europeans, who aren't even\nbetter hockey players. It's all hype.

Olson was still\nrecovering from his late-season injury (knee, I believe),\nand there were questions as to whether he would be\nable to play before June.  And then Berryhill was dinged up.\n\nI was looking forward to this, because I believe that Lopez\ncan hit AND field the position.  Before last season, he was\nthe Braves \"Defensive Catcher\" prospect, while Brian Deak was\nthe Braves \"Offensive Catcher\" prospect.  Besides, Olson\nand Berryhill couldn't hit their way out of a wet cardboard\nbox, and don't walk enough to be useful.\n\nBut Olson recovered quickly, Berryhill recovered, and the Braves went\nwith the two vets.  I still say that if one of those two had been down\nat the start of the season, he wouldn't have gotten his job back.\n\n2)  There is a certain logic to keeping Olson and Berryhill around.\nAfter all, ML catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and\ntear.  There are teams out there without ONE average ML catcher\n(California and Seattle come to mind).  Certainly, trying to\nmove Olson or Berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work.\nPlus, you'd have to eat that salary, which isn't huge, but isn't\ntiddleywinks either (I think Olson's at about $800,000, Berryhill\nat $450,000, but that's only what I recall).\n\n3)  Yes, I think arbitration-eligibility may have a role to\nplay in this also.  What is it, that 5\/6 of the 2+year players\naren't eligible for arbitration?   Only the 1\/6 that were on the roster\nthe longest are eligible?  Of course, the system may change,\nbut the extent of that change is not yet known.  From a business\nstandpoint, it may make sense to keep Lopez down until June\/the\nfirst time Olson\/Berryhill go on the DL.\n\n4)  I am still disappointed that Lopez isn't on the team.\nI still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the Braves,\nand the truth is that I'd rather see our best team on the field,\nwhich, IMO, includes Lopez.\n\nOf course,today we play the Cubs.  Hopefully, we won't need him. ;)\n\nAs for the Schuerholz\/Cox conversation, I imagine it went\nlike this:  (Remember, they've BOTH been GM's)\n(the following is not meant to be read by the humor-impaired)\n\nCox:  OK, we've sent Jones down.  His fielding could be a\nlittle smoother.  Besides, Blauser can hit OK and his fielding\nis better than it used to be.\n\nSchuerholz:  Well, we'll have to send Nieves down too.  Deion\njust won't sign that baseball only contract.  We can't count\non him in October, so we have to keep Nixon around for the\ndefense.  Besides, Gorman's not ready to give up on\nBilly Hatcher yet.  Once Hatcher's gone AND Deion signs,\nwe can move Nixon for Frankie Rodriguez.  That ought to\ngive us some pitching depth in 1995.\n\nCox:  Yep, that'll be nice.  Too bad Deion won't sign.\nOK, I'll look for Nieves when Justice starts having\nBerry-Berry...er, back problems again.  Now, what about\nKlesko?\n\nSchuerholz:  Well, we've still got to fork out another 1.5 mil\nfor Bream.  If we keep Klesko, we either lose the money\nor Cabrera.  I keep dangling Sid in front of Dal Maxwell,\nbut somehow he doesn't seem to be the same GM.  First\nJeffries for Jose, and now Whiten for Clark!  If he\ngets rid of Brian Jordan, then I'd HAVE to believe that he\nand Whitey Herzog switched bodies at the Winter Meetings!\n\nCox:  OK, keep trying on Bream, and I'll wait til the trading\ndeadline for my Hunter\/Klesko platoon.  Maybe I can get a few\nextra at-bats for Cabrera while we wait.  Try California...\nif Snow starts slowly, maybe WhiteyDal will bite on Sid.\nAnd if that doesn't work, then perhaps Sid's knees\ncould be \"persuaded\" to act up.  There's always the\n15-day DL!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!\n\nSchuerholz:  What about Caraballo?\n\nCox:  Well, he's not that much better than Lemke.  Maybe if he starts\nin Richmond, he'll start walking more.  Besides, if he's going to be\narbitration-eligible, better to stretch him out so that we actually\nget some value from him before he makes the big bucks.\n\nSchuerholz:  Now, let's see.  That leaves Lopez.\n\nCox:  NOOOOO!  I gotta keep Lopez!  Sure, I didn't think Olson\nwould recover this quickly.  Maybe I can talk Caminiti into\nrunning into him again?\n\nSchuerholz:  Nope, Lopez has gotta go.  You know that he'll get\n$3 million in arbitration.  May as well put it off that one\nextra year.  Besides, until Olson's shown his stuff a little\nbit, I can't trade him.  Besides, Berryhill's a left-handed\nhitter.  You know how rare that is?\n\nCox:  Don't you mean a left-handed whiffer?  Pretty common,\nif you ask me.  I mean, he made Pat Borders look good in\nthe World Series.  PAT BORDERS!!!\n\nSchuerholz:  Hey, you're the one who wouldn't write Lopez\ninto the lineup.\n\nCox:  Well, you're the one who went out and got me Jeff\nReardon!  Besides, I thought Lopez wouldn't be used\nto our pitching staff's stuff.  He got some time with\nthem this spring...looked pretty good.  Come on, surely\nwe only need to keep one stiff behind the plate?\n\nSchuerholz:  Yeah, but which stiff?  Whichever one we keep\nwill be hurt by May.\n\nCox:  OK, OK, you made your point.  Keep them both.  Surely\none of them will be on the DL by June at the latest.  Then I\ncan call up Lopez, and then we can win 110 games!  The Pennant!\nTHE WORLD SERIES!

I found the same ratios for HR.\n\nYear  rpg   lea  ratio  hrpg lea ratio   \n1992 10.22  9.10 1.12   1.65 1.58 1.04\n1991  9.53  8.87 1.07   1.41 1.26 1.12\n1990 10.71  8.72 1.23   1.49 1.24 1.20\n1989  9.07  8.34 1.09   1.27 1.11 1.14\n1988  9.90  8.37 1.18   1.29 1.08 1.19\n1987 12.55 10.70 1.17   2.39 1.92 1.24\n1986  9.45  9.33 1.01   1.35 1.38  .98\n1985  9.50  8.54 1.11   1.53 1.34 1.14\n1984  9.99  9.10 1.10   1.55 1.59  .97\n1983 10.60  9.99 1.06   2.03 1.74 1.17\n1982 11.29 10.35 1.09   2.24 1.91 1.17\n1981 10.29  9.25 1.11   1.43 1.49  .96\n1980 10.59  9.43 1.12   1.63 1.46 1.12\n      1446\/13-->1.11     1444\/13-->1.11\n\nIt seems pretty clear that Denver will have a large effect \non runs scored (I'll stick with my prediction from last year \nthat it'll be one of the top 3 in the NL this year) \nand a fairly large effect on Homeruns - though apparently not as large as \nAtlanta, Wrigley, Cincinnati and San Diego.\nStill it ought to be a pretty decent home run park.\n\njohn rickert\nrickert@nextwork.rose-hulman.edu\n\n###\n\n","completion":" baseball"}

EDT\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning ladies and gentlemen.  It's\nan honor for me to welcome the University of Maine Black Bears, the\nwinner of the NCAA Division I hockey national championship to the\nRose Garden and the White House.  I understand from Senator Mitchell\nthat this is the first team from the University of Maine every to win\na national championship.  And we're glad to have them here.\n\n     I'm inspired not only by how the team pulled together to\nwin the championship, but how the entire state pulled together to\ncheer them onto victory.\n\n     Coming from a state that is also relatively small in\nsize, but also filled with pride and tradition and community, I can\nunderstand how the people of Maine must feel about the Black Bears.\nIn our state people are still talking about the time we won the\nOrange Bowl over the number one ranked football team, and that was\nback in 1978.  I'm sure that 15 years from now, the people of Maine\nwill as proud of this team as they are today.\n\n     You know, in my state football is a slightly more\npopular sport than hockey.  We don't have a lot of ice.  (Laughter.)\nBut after spending three months getting banged around in this town, I\ncan understand a little more about hockey than I did before I came\nhere.  Hockey is a tough game.  It's a hard-hitting sport.  It does\nhave one virtue though, there's a penalty for delay of game.  I wish\nwe had that rule in the Senate.  (Laughter.)\n\n     In government as in hockey, leadership is important.  In\nthe United States Senate, our team has a great captain, the Majority\nLeader and the senior Senator from Maine, George Mitchell; junior\nSenator -- Cohen looks so young, I can't imagine.  (Laughter.)  I'm\nactually bitter about Senator Cohen because he looks so much younger\nthan me.\n\n     On your hockey team, the captain Jim Montgomery has done\na great job.  He scored the winning goal late in the championship\ngame, leading you to a come-from-behind victory -- something else I\nknow a little bit about.\n\n     Sport brings out the best in individuals and in teams\nand in communities.  I share the pride that Senator Mitchell and\nSenator Cohen and Congressman Andrews and all the people of Maine\nmust feel for the Black Bears who have shown us all how to play as a\nteam, how to bring out the best in one another, and how to come from\nbehind.\n\n     I think it's important, as I ask young people from\naround America who have achieved outstanding things in working\ntogether, to come here to the White House to be recognized and\nappreciated by their country, to remember that those kinds of values\nand those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for all\nof our lives.\n\n     We now have another role model, and I'm glad to have\nthem here today.  (Applause.)\n\n     (The President is presented with team jersey.)\n(Applause.)\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  That's great.  I love it.  It's beautiful.\n(Applause.)\n\n     (The President is presented with an autographed stick.)\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  That's great.  (Applause.)\n\n                             * * * * * *\n\n     Q  Mr. President, did you authorize the move on Waco\nthis morning, sir?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I was aware of it.  I think the Attorney\nGeneral made the decision.  And I think I should refer all questions\nto her and to the FBI.\n\n     Q  Did you have any instructions for her as to how it\nshould be executed?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  No, they made the tactical decisions.\nThat was their judgment, the FBI.\n\n     Q  Is this a raid?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  And I will -- I want to refer you to --\ntalk to the Attorney General and the FBI.  I knew it was going to be\ndone, but the decisions were entirely theirs, all the tactical\ndecisions.\n\n     Q  What did you and Senator Mitchell talk about this\nmorning?\n\n     Q  Any chance for that stimulus package?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Senator Mitchell ought to pay my\nquarter.  (Laughter.)  I was in there -- (laughter).\n\n     SENATOR MITCHELL:  You have to pay that quarter.\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I was ready.  (Laughter.)  Senator\nMitchell, he's worth a quarter any day.\n\n     Q  Any chance for your bill, sir?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  We talked about what was going to happen\nthis week in the Senate and about what other meetings we're going to\nhave for the rest of the week.

And many of those\npurposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the American people\nback to work.  I don't want to go back and revisit every one, but you\n\n\ncan do it.  You can look at the research there.  So this position\nthey're taking is not credible.  We have a very tough five-year\ndeficit reduction plan.  All these costs are covered during that time\nand then some.  And the very people that are saying this has all got\nto be paid for don't have much of a history on which to base their\nposition.  They've got 12 years of vote for stimulus measures of this\nkind that had very little to with putting the American people back to\nwork.

There are 30 to 50 Florida\nPanthers in the Everglades National Park, the Big Cypress National \nPreserve and other parts of southwestern Florida.\n\n\"The Panther is the quickest-striking of all cats,\" Torrey said.  \n\"Hopefully that's the way we'll play on ice.\"\n\nMore BIO:\nIn Torrey, Huizenga has the first man hired by the expansion Islanders\nin 1972 and the one most responsible for guiding the Islanders to four\nconsecutive Stanley Cup championships (their first after only eight\nseasons) and 14 consecutive winning seasons.  As executive vice president\nof the California Golden Seals, Torrey watched the Seals go to the play-\noffs in 1968, only their second NHL season.\n\n\"I guess this completes my own personal hat trick\", said Torrey, 58, a\nnative of Montreal but a resident of Bear Lakes Country Club in Palm\nBeach.\n\nJim G.\nother accounts:\ngorycki@sol.cse.fau.edu\njimg@cybernet.cse.fau.edu\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\"I repeat myself when under stress.

The idea was that youngsters could\nplay almost as well, and had the potential to improve where these\nolder guys did not. \nAnd they traded Mullen, because he wanted to go, not because he\nwasn't good enough, but I think they were a bit too optimistic\nin thinking they could make up for his contributions.\nAn example from this season, Skriko was brought in on a trial basis\nbut not kept, because of his age. I thought he was a decent\ncontributor worth keeping around.\n\nThe youth movement has its advantages; look at Gaudreau who\nmight still be in KC if more veterans had been kept around.

How good does their rotation look?  The last I heard, the order is\n>Tapani, Erikson, Mahomes, Banks, and some guy I've never heard of. \n>(sounds pretty pathetic to me)\n\nWell, maybe it will be.  Banks is a 24 year-old prospect who \"hasn't \nmatured as quickly as they would have liked.  Mahomes is a 22 year-old \nwho is very highly touted.  Tapani and Erickson are also young, and \nhave looked very good this spring.  The last spot was between Jim \nDeshaies, formerly of Houston and S.D. and Mike Trombley.  Deshaies \nhasn't looked very good this spring, so I believe that the spot has \ngone to Trombley, although they hadn't wanted 3 starters this unproven. \nI personally believe very highly in Mahomes and Trombley.\n\n>\n>2.  Who is playing short and third?\n\nWell, Scott Leius is the shortstop.  He played mostly 3B last year, but \nwas a SS in the minors, and moved back after Gagne left to K.C.  3B is \nsplit (maybe) between Pagliarulo, who has had a great spring, and Terry \nJorgenson, a good looking kid who has languished in Portland for 3 \nyears.  I'm not sure how the time will be divided, but they seem to be \nhappy with what they have here.  I like Jorgenson, but I fear they \nmight give too much time to Pags.\n \n>3.  How's Winfield doing?\n\nSorry, can't help you here.\n\nDennis\n\n###\n\n","completion":" baseball"}

Hence, they did help build the league, although\nthey were not great players themselves.  \n\n\tI agree that a name is a name is a name, and if some people\nhave trouble with names that are not easily processed by the fans,\nthen changing them to names that are more easily processed seems like\na reasonable idea.  If we can get people in the (arena) door by being\nuncomplicated, then let's do so.  Once we have them, they will realize\nwhat a great game hockey is, and we can then teach them something\nabotu the history of the game.  \n \n>The history of the names can be put rather succinctly.

Conn Smythe, for example, was a classy\nindividual (from what I have heard). \n\n\tAlso, isn't the point of \"professional\" hockey to make money\nfor all those involved, which would include the players.  What I think\nyou might be saying is that the players have not made as much money as\nshould have been their due, and it is the players that are what make\nthe game great not the people who put them on the ice, so naming\ndivision after management people rather than players is adding insult\n(in the form of lesser recognition) to injury (less money than was\ndeserved).   \n\n_______________________\nEvan Pritchard --------  Number 1 or 9 depending on the hockey pool \n=======================\nepritcha@psych.uiuc.edu\n\n###\n\n","completion":" hockey"}

Sci.\nLines: 74\n\nI've noticed that is has become fashionable lately in rsb to predict\nthe Marlines to finish ahead of the Cubs....how?\n\nFirst Base:\n\nGrace vs Destrade...Could Destrade be the second coming of Cecil\nFielder? I doubt it. If Destrade performs to the height of expectations,\nthen even, otherwise, edge to Cubs\n\nSecond Base:\n\nSandberg vs Barberie...No contest. Sandberg will be back May 1. Edge\nto Cubs...a big edge.\n\nShortstop:\n\nVizcaino vs Weiss...Vizcaino is excellent defensively, but is an\nautomatic out at bat. Weiss isn't much better with the stick. Even.\n\nThird Base:\n\nDave Magadan vs Buechelle...Magadan has a higher OBP and is a better hitter.\nBuechelle has more power and is better defensively (I think) Edge to\nFlorida.\n\nCatcher: \n\nSantiago vs Wilkins...Wilkins is OK, but Santiago is better. Edge to\nMarlins\n\nLeft Field:\n\nConine vs Maldonado...Wow! 4 for 4 yesterday...I know Conine has potential.\nI watched him play at Omaha the last couple years. Until he actually proves\nhimself, I give Maldonado the edge, however, like at 1B, this is position\nwhere Florida might be even or better *if* the player there has a huge year.\n\nCenter:\n\nScott Pose vs Wilson\/May...Edge to May, even if Wilson. Hopefully the\nCubs will use may and save Wilson for pinch running and the like. May\nisn't Ken Griffey Jr, but he will hit .275 with 15 homers if he plays\nfull time.\n\nRight:\n\nFelix vs Sosa...Felix Jose has occasional power and a bad OBP. So does\nSosa, but Sosa also has speed and a good glove. Edge to Cubs\n\nStarters:\n\nAquino? Armstrong? Hammond? A lot of fifth starters here. The Cubs won't\nremind anyone of the Brave staff, but Morgan-Castillo-Guzman-Hibbard\nis average to OK...better than the Marline. Edge to Cubs\n\nMiddle Relief:\n\nEven. The Cubs have some decent middlemen, and so do the Marlins.\nCarpenter anf Klink or decent, but so are Assenmacher and McElroy.\n\nCloser:\n\nA healthy Harvey is a big edge to the Marlins. Meyers is decent, but\nno Harvey. Of course, the Cubs may have a few more games to save.\nLook for 30 saves, 5 blown from Meyers, and 25 saves, 3 blown (with\na better ERA) for Harvey. Edge Florida.\n\nOverall, an edge to Chicago.\nNeither of these teams will threaten to win anything, of course.\ne\n--\nmsilverm@nyx.cs.du.edu\t\t\t\tGO CUBS!!!\n\n\"One likes to believe in the freedom of baseball\" - Geddy Lee\n\n###\n\n","completion":" baseball"}

It turns out that the mask is\ncustom-fit to the goalie's face.  The goalie puts his\/her face through a\npiece of wood (or was it plastic?) with a hole in it that allows only the face\nand forehead to show.  Hair is covered by a cap, eyes are covered by a plastic\nwrap-type material, and vaseline is put on the goaltender's face.

This is used as the basis of the mask (the rest involves\npadding the inside, hardening the exterior, fitting the cage, etc. etc.  \nJohn Blue of the Bruins actually demonstrated the procedure on the show. \n\n>He exhibited a couple masks he is currently working on, namely, a\n>new mask for Andy Moog which is a basic re-working of his current\n>mask with the bear on it, and new mask for Bob Essensa which was \n>*really* cool -- the Jets logo was on the chin, and there were two\n>fighter jets on either side on the forehead with an air-brushed\n>back-ground.\n\nYeah, Essensa's mask looked really good.\n \n>The best one of all was one he never talked about, he just held it up.\n>It has the current Leafs crest on the chin and an awesome looking \n>black panther on the forehead -- it *has* to be a new mask for Felix\n>Potvin, but he never said whose it was.\n\nActually, I thought I heard him say that it _was_ Potvin's for certain.

Are you saying that a kid who moves from AA to AAA\nand then does not improve would have been better off making a\ndirect leap to the majors?  If a player does well at AA and then\ndoes not improve at AAA, isn't that a sign that maybe he doesn't\nbelong in the bigs?\n\nNow, Keith Mitchell.  As I recall (no stat books handy - surprise!)\nhe jumped from AA to Atlanta in 1991.  He did so well that he was\nreturned to the minors, where he didn't do very well at all.  Now\nhis career is in jeopardy.  So how does he fit in with your \npoint.  Good MLE's in AA.  Moved him right to the big club.  Now\nhe's one step away from being traded or moved out of baseball.\nDuh.\n\n\n>That was me, and you so far your only counter-proposal is that they\n>really don't understand how good Lopez is, or overvalue experience,\n>or some combination of the two.

And that kind of invisibility was prevalent for the most part\nfor DePalma.  After being called up October 30 against the Tampa Bay Lightning,\nDePalma had an excellent week, scoring 5 points in 3 games while playing good\ndefense.  Unfortunately, the 27-year-old DePalma then disappeared the rest of\nthe way, getting just 3 more points in 15 more games, and generally looked\nlethargic and uninterested on both ends of the ice.  He then was sent down to\nKansas City, walked out from there, and was suspended and later reinstated\nwhen it was revealed that he was injured; he then promptly disappeared from\nthe watching eyes of Shark Bytes (as the mailing list is now known to Sharks\nofficials) faithful, and neither the Sharks nor we miss him.\n\n#10\tJOHAN GARPENLOV\t\tSeason: 3rd\nAcquired:\t'91-92, trade with Detroit for D Bob McGill and 8th round\n\t\tpick in '92 entry draft from Vancouver\nGrade:\t\tA\/A-\n\nAfter an early slump, Garpenlov was nothing short of inspirational the rest\nof the way, finishing with 66 points in 79 games, second highest total on the\nteam, as he clicked well with team MVP Kelly Kisio and right wing Rob\nGaudreau.  Kisio got most of the credit, but Garpenlov, finishing second in\nthe MVP voting, clearly demonstrated his playmaking and scoring skills, as he\nwas seen making excellent centering passes as well as finishing passes to him\nby putting the puck past opposing goaltenders, getting a club-high 14 power-\nplay goals.  Contrary to his previous rep, Garpenlov also showed that despite\nhis small size (5' 11\", 183 lbs.), he was willing to throw himself around\nwhen necessary, albeit not very successful yet.  He also still needs to work\non his defense, although he improved tremendously throughout the season, and\nwas actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the season.  He will\nbe a major key to the offense next year.\n\n#15\tDAVID BRUCE\t\tSeason: 5th\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from St. Louis in expansion draft\nGrade:\t\tI (?)\n\nAfter a banner '91-92, when he led the team in power-play goals (10) and\nwas third in total scoring (38 points in 60 games), Bruce was bothered\nvirtually all of this season with a groin injury, which kept him out of the\nlineup for all by 17 games this season.  Of course, it is difficult to\nspeculate how well he would have done this season had he not been affected by\nthe injury, but the 28-year-old Bruce was effective with a man up or a man\nshort in the Sharks' first season, and was expected to be a strong offensive\nleader this season as well.  The injury appears serious, which is a shame,\nbecause otherwise he may have a much brighter future for now; instead, his\nfuture with the Sharks next season appears clouded.\n\n#18\tMARK PEDERSON\t\tSeason:\t3rd\nAcquired:\t'92-93, trade with Philadelphia for C\/LW Dave Snuggerud\nGrade:\t\tI (B)\n\nIt is difficult for me to understand the Flyers' decision to unload Pederson,\nafter a very good offensive season last season (40 points in 58 games), but\nafter riding the pine early in the season, Pederson was summarily sent to the\nSharks in exchange of the defensive-minded Snuggerud, and he finished with\n41 games combined with the Flyers and the Sharks.  He was also limited by\ninjuries this season, and this limited his production (17 points).  But when\nhealthy, Pederson appears impressive, with a good scoring touch, good size\n(and the willingness to throw it around, although he's not considered a\nphysical forward), and good speed.  He also does not appear to be a liability\non defense, but the Sharks probably have to wait until next season to see how\nmuch, exactly, Pederson can do.\n\n#20\tJOHN CARTER\t\tSeason: 4th\nAcquired:\t'91-92, free agent from Boston\nGrade:\t\tI (B+\/B)\n\nCarter was definitely one of the hardest workers on the team, and the hard\nwork worked wonders, as at times he looked great on ice.  However, although he\ndid look great at times, the fact that he received just 16 points (in 55\ngames) for his efforts is a sign that there is only so much his hard work can\ndo, and the Sharks confirmed that by sending him to Kansas City with about\n20 games left in the season.  Carter, who will turn 30 on May 6, always\nhussled, but as a result, was sometimes trapped too deep within the offensive\nzone while forechecking, but he was generally a credit on the defensive end,\nbut he is probably of limited utility in that capacity, and he did not impress\noffensively, although he was one of the best Sharks at drawing penalties.  He\nis very unlikely to be back next season.\n\n#28\tJEAN-FRANCOIS QUINTIN\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tI (B+\/B)\n\nI don't understand why the Sharks didn't let Quintin play any more than the\n14 games he played this season.  He was generally hard-working and creating\nopportunities offensively, and appeared, at age 23, ready for regular NHL\nduty, at least for a team like the Sharks, finishing with 7 points in those\n14 games while not being a defensive liability.  Shoulder injury in training\ncamp before the '91-92 season limited Quintin, the team's leading scorer in\nexhibition games despite sitting out the final two, to just 29 games with the\nSharks and the Blades that season, but he looked impressive.  He should be a\nsolid contender for regular duty next season.\n\n#41\tMARK BEAUFAIT\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t2nd round pick in 1991 supplemental draft\nGrade:\t\tI (?)\n\nAfter a all-star season at Kansas City, Beaufait got a cup of coffey with the\nSharks late in the season when the Blades knocked down a playoff spot and the\nSharks decimated with injuries, playing 5 games and scoring a goal for his only\nNHL point thus far.  Despite small size (5' 9\", 165 lbs.), Beaufait was not shy\nto throw himself around when necessary, and looked pretty good at times,\nalthough it's too early to judge him based on 5 NHL games, in which he played\nmostly left wing, away from his center position at Northern Michigan and\nKansas City.\n\n#42\tJAROSLAV OTEVREL\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t8th round pick in 1991 entry draft\nGrade:\t\tI (?)\n\nLike Beaufait, Otevrel also played away from his normal position when he was\nup for his cup of tea (7 games) midway through the season.  He was generally\nvery much of a defensive liability, and did not show much offensively either,\nalthough that may be more indicative of the lack of ice time he got in those\n7 games.  He may need another season to work on his defense, but once his\ndefense is acceptable, he should be ready.\n\n#44\tMICHEL PICARD\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t'92-93, trade with Hartford for LW Yvon Corriveau\nGrade:\t\tI (B-\/C+)\n\nThe 23-year-old Picard, although he perennially tore up the minors, seems to\nbe close to being out of chances, for some reason, after being acquired by the\nSharks but failing to impress the management in 25 games, scoring 4 goals for\nhis only points, and he spent most of the rest of the way in Kansas City.\nHe was not particularly strong defensively, and despite his offensive\nbrilliance in the minors, he has failed thus far to score in the NHL, although\nhe has been given limited opportunities.  He may be the Sharks' bait in the\nexpansion draft.\n\n#45\tDODY WOOD\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t3rd round pick in 1991 entry draft\nGrade:\t\tI (D+\/D, although perhaps I shouldn't give a grade at all)\n\nI have been accused of knocking on Wood too much. :-)  Then, it is probably\nno surprise to you that I am thoroughly unimpressed by Wood thus far, although\n13 games is a small example.  He was generally a nonfactor on offense, was\nnot particularly good defensively, and took too many silly penalties, losing\nmany fights in the process and gathering 69 penalty minutes in those 13 games,\nprojecting to to 446(!) in an 84-game season.  He's not ready, and needs at\nleast another season at KC, where he can work on his fighting skills, if\nnothing else.  His relatively small size (5' 11\", 181 lbs.) does not give much\npossibility that he can survive, at this stage, as an enforcer.\n\n===============================================================================\nGO CALGARY FLAMES!

If you check the THN stats for\nKansas City, you'll find that Larry has been playing for the games, having\nplayed in 8 games in the period covered in the stats between 3\/26 and the\n4\/16 issue (1-3-4 with 13 PIM).

He injured his back (a disk injury) and did one stupid thing,\nwhich was to hide it from the Sharks and he tried to play through it because\nhe knew he was on the bubble. The Sharks then sent him to K.C., at which\npoint he disclosed the injury. Since he didn't disclose it, the Sharks and\nhe disagreed about the responsibility and he was suspended for not\nreporting. That was eventually worked out, the Sharks re-instated him as\ninjured and put him into therapy, and when he was able to play then shipped\nhim down to K.C. He fully expects to play in the NHL again, although clearly\nnot with the Sharks (hiding injuries is a stupid no-no, beyond just a\nno-no).\n\nVery nice guy. Always hustled his butt off. He disappeared because he was\nhurt. I expect he'll surface with another team at some point (probably\nanother expansion team), but is likely to be a bubble player for the rest of\nhis career. Has a good work ethic and is good at getting other players\nmotivated.

His future with the Sharks was made clear to me\none night against the Flames when he went behind the crease and tried to\nhold Joel Otto against the board. He literally had one arm around Otto's\nneck and another wrapped around Otto's stick arm. Otto casually turned\naround and fed the puck in front of the crease for a goal, as though Carter\nwasn't there. Hustle can only cover size so far.\n\nThe Sharks have told me, point blank, that he's gone for good (ditto HUbie\nMcDonough). He was one of the favorites of the staff, but as one said to me\n\"you have to make room for the kids\". Carter, in fact, refused to report to\nK.C. and has been suspended by the Sharks. That might be a defacto\nretirement, but I haven't heard anything official. His only hope in hockey\nnow is the Gulls.\n\n>#28\tJEAN-FRANCOIS QUINTIN\tSeason: 1st\n>Acquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\n>Grade:\t\tI (B+\/B)\n\n>I don't understand why the Sharks didn't let Quintin play any more than the\n>14 games he played this season.\n\nBecause, at least from the games I saw him in, he was outmatched and looked\nfairly lost on the ice.

Of course I can't say this\nfor sure, but I believe that this is fairly typical of human nature and I\ndon't think that hockey players are above having what I consider typically\nhuman attitudes.  \n\nWith the recent salary escalations the key players are actually losing \nmoney by participating in the playoffs.  The ones who regard the playoff\n\"take\" as some kind of a bonanza are fringe players who are unlikely\nto consistently be a force in the playoffs.

While they may love to play the \ngame that love is entirely incidental to their purpose, which is, to make\na decent living. \n\nOf course, the coach is a professional as well, and part of what he is \nbeing paid to do is motivate the players.  So, if the coach does his\njob well enough the players may respond with a winning effort.\n\nThe second season, is after all, merely an exhibition.  The true Champions\nof the league are the division winners, the teams that come out on top \nafter the long struggle of the season.  The Stanley cup playoffs merely\naccord victory to the team that has remained healthy and \"hot\".  The \nemphasis on the playoffs, with their \"sudden death\" appeal has been promoted\nby the media and the owners with profit purely in mind.  Even if Pittsburgh\nloses the playoffs, we all know that they were really the best team in the\nleague over the year.

If a player is on the ice when his team scores a\nlot of goals and only allows a few goals, he must be doing something right.\nIt is especially useful to compare between teammates- as they play for the\nsame team and should have roughly similar +\/- ratings if they are equally\ngood players.

A very good player could be given low\namounts of quality ice time because of team depth or a stupid coach who\ndoesn't recognize his talent and a very bad player could be given lots of\nquality ice time because of a lack of team depth or a stupid coach that\nthinks he is an effective player.

The OT game winner came from Dimitri\nYushkevich, just his 5th of the season and his first game winner. The FLYERS\nnever led up until that point in the game. For the Whalers, the loss marked an\nNHL record 9th OT loss this season.\n\nRoster move:\n\nGord Hynes was called to to play in place of Ryan McGill\n\nInjuries:\n\nRyan McGill injured his hand in a fight 4\/15 and was scratched.\n\nLines:\n\nEklund-Lindros-Recchi\nBeranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen\nLomakin-Butsayev-Conroy\nFaust-Acton-Brown\n\nGalley-Bowen\nYushkevich-Hawgood\nCarkner-Hynes\n\nDominic Roussel\n\nGame Summary:\n\nI didn't get TV coverage of the game, and since it was stormy in these parts\nI didn't have the best radio coverage either. Here's the box score followed by\na few things I did pick up:\n\nFirst Period:\n\tHartford, Nylander 10, 8:51\n\tPhiladelphia, Recchi 53 (Lindros, Brind'Amour), 19:59.8 (pp)\nPenalties - Verbeek, Har (holding), :55; Carkner, Phi (roughing), 13:53; Houda,\nHar (interference) 18:43\n\nSecond Period:\n\tHartford, Burt 6 (Cunneyworth, Kron), 2:00\n\tPhiladelphia, Bowen 1 (Eklund, Recchi), 7:09\n\tHartford, Nylander 11 (Zalapski, Sanderson), 9:38\nPenalties - Galley, Phi, major-game misconduct (spearing) :58; Verbeek, Har\nmajor-game misconduct (spearing), :58; Brown, Phi (tripping), 3:22; Zalapski,\nHar (tripping), 15:51; Brind'Amour, Phi (slashing), 19:50\n\nThird Period:\n\tHartford, Kron 14 (Sanderson, Cassels), 1:24 (pp)\n\tPhiladelphia, Beranek 15 (Lomakin, Yushkevich), 3:11\n\tPhiladelphia, Faust 2 (Brind'Amour, Roussel), 3:38\nPenalties - Houda, Har (tripping), 4:20; Hawgood, Phi (holding), 5:30\n\nOvertime:\n\tPhiladelphia, Yushkevich 5 (Faust), 1:15.\nPenalties - None\n\nPower Play:\n\tPhiladelphia 1 of 4, Hartford 1 of 4\n\nGoalies:\n\tPhiladelphia, Roussel 14-11-5 (30 shots - 26 saves)\n\tHartford, Lenarduzzi, 1-1-1 (38 - 33)\n\nOn the first Hartford goal, Gord Hynes misplayed the puck at the FLYERS blue\nline and Nylander stripped him and took off.\n\nThe Recchi goal was a 2 on 1 with Lindros.\n\nThe Bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net, got a good carom and it\nended up behind the goalie.\n\nOn the second Nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in.\nThis is the most frustrating part of the FLYERS defense. Take the body, and if\nthey get one shot and beat you fine. Don't give them another chance. Carkner,\nGalley and McGill are all terrible about this, I'll bet money at least one of\nthem was the closest FLYER to the play.\n\nThat's all I have, my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who it\nwas that scored, much less how.\n\nFrom what I heard, Roussel had a very strong game. After the game, Gene Hart\nasked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the\ngame. It was Garry Galley #3 for his career high point total (I'm surprised\nthat a former goalie wouldn't look closer at his defensive play), Tommy \nSoderstrom #2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1\/2 a season\nand, Mark Recchi #1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark.\nBut here's the odd part. He couldn't decide between Lindros and Recchi for\nnumber 1. If he picks Recchi as #1 after he had a hard time choosing between\nhim and Lindros, doesn't that make Lindros #2????\n\nWhat? You wanna know my three stars of the season? Well, since you asked...\n\n#1 Eric Lindros. Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice.\nThe difference between the team's record with him and without him is no\naccident. I believe that the team could have been almost as successful without\nRecchi. There is no question that this team is significantly better with Eric\nLindros on it, and I think that he will deservedly wear the 'C' on his jersey\nnext season.\n\n#2 Tommy Soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour,\nand Tommy didn't have a Chris Chelios (booo) in front of him. He also didn't\nplay a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here, my family\nhas a history of heart problems). There's no question in my mind that Tommy\nSoderstrom is this teams goalie of the future, and if Roussel complains again\nabout being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years.\n\n#3 Mark Recchi. Again, you can't argue with an all-time team high single season\nscoring mark. There are an awful lot of teams that didn't have a single player\nget as many points. Plus, Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season.\nNot a tough choice.\n\nHonorable mentions: Rod Brind'Amour topped his single season high point total\nwhich he set last year. The difference was that he wasn't on the top line\nthis year and didn't get as much playing time. Then again, he didn't get the\ndefensive attention that he got last year from the other team either.\n\nDimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. Yes, he made rookie\nmistakes, but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. I have a feeling\nthat with his shot he'll score a few more points next year without giving up\nanything in his own zone, and I suspect that he'll be the teams top defenseman\nin years to come.\n\nGarry Galley was the team's point leader from defensemen. Again, there are some\nthings you just can't argue with. And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome,\nhe certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game, and that was against his\nwishes under doctors orders. But his defensive play often negates his offensive\ncontribution. A little more caution, and a little bit smarter in his own end\nwill make him a much more important part of the team next year.\n\nBrent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total.\nBut consistency became a problem for him.\n\nA couple misc notes mostly for mailing list members:\n\nTom Misnik, a member of the mailing list, would like to exchange E-mail\naddresses with any list members who want to keep in touch over the summer.\nIf you're interested, you can send him mail at:\n\natt!ACR.ORG!TMISNIK\n\nThe FLYERS end the season 1 game below .500 in 5th place, their best winning\npercentage since going .500 in 1988-89. 14-20-3 within the division (4th in\nPatrick), 23-14-5 at home. They finished 17th overall, will draft 10th in\nnext years entry draft (Quebec had the 1st rounder, though). They scored as\nmany goals as they allowed, 319.\n\nThe 8 straight wins is the most since they won 13 in a row in 1985.\n\nI will be sending out final stats as soon as I get the issue of the Hockey\nNews that contains them, since there are no more games for me to go to I have\nno other way of getting them.\n\nI hope you've all enjoyed this years hockey season as much as I have.

Everybody said it would come down to goaltending, that\ngoaltending was the key, etc etc.  Well, the key doesn't quite fit if you're\nMontreal.

Blaming Stewart is just an\nexcuse to avoid facing the fact that Roy allowed what was one of the worst\ngoals he could possibly allow.  He even saw the whole shot, dammit.  Besides,\nStewart evened things up a bit by calling a Quebec penalty in OT.\n\nMontreal played a solid game (although they still don't know how to clear\ntraffic in front of the net; the loss of Schneider will hurt even more). \nNormally I would say that any team that blows a 2-goal lead with less than \nfive, let alone two, minutes to go in regulation time IN A PLAYOFF GAME \nESPECIALLY needs to be smacked upside their collective heads.

I haven't seen a\nteam so potent on the rush in a long time.  Watching them break out of their\nzone, especially Sundin, is a treat to watch.  They remind me of the Red \nArmy.  \n\nBut I still hate the team.\n\nOn the rest of the games:  Didn't St. Louis' winning goal come on a\npowerplay?

He hit three 6 times.  I am almost sure about this. In\ncase anyone is wondering, the record for two homer games is held by Babe\nRuth and is 72.  Mize's record may not last for much longer because of Juan\nGonzalez.  He has at least three games with three and maybe 4.  I know that \nhe had at least two last year and one as a rookie.  I don't have any record\nbooks at college for me to check on though.  Please let me know, okay, if I \nam wrong.  \n\tOnto the Padres.  Is there anyone out there who follows them?- especial-ly those with access to local news?  I don't here anything in Los Angeles and I\ncan't get McPaper consistently around here.  \ncomment:  It looks as though San Diego has gotten the better of the two deals\nthat brought Bell and Plantier to the Padres.  It has also forced the team to use Darrell Shermann.  Of course, Plantier could get injured again or he could \nhit with the power of 91 but with a lower average.  Bell always could finish\nwith .240 and 15-18 hrs-essentially Jerald Clark's numbers.  \nleadoff comment:  Craig Shipley??????  I get on base 29% of the time if I'm \nlucky at leadoff?  Hell, of the usual starters, use Gwynn.  He's got 4 steals\nalready.  Is Shipley starting because of an injury to Stillwell, though?  I\nhaven't seen Stillwell's name in any box scores.  Anyway unless you are going\nto use Shermann at leadoff then use Gwynn.  He at lesat gets on base and this\nyear is stealing bases.\nSheffield comment:  Though the season is early and stats mean nothing.\nWitness Phillips batting .500+ currently.  But does Sheffield have an injury,\nor anythingelse wrong with him.
